# Silver-Sonic-in-S3AIR
The Story:
After EggMan made Mecha Sonic (with the parts of Mecha Sonic (Sonic 2) and Metal Sonic) he threw away the extra parts and Miles Tails Prower found the spare pieces and rebuilt Mecha Sonic and gave some extra abilities because of the Metal Sonic parts and reprogrammed him to be good and battle EggMan
